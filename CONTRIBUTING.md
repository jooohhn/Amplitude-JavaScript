# Contributing to the Amplitude SDK for JavaScript

ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for your interest in contributing! ðŸŽ‰

## Ramping Up

### Intro

- There are three ways for SDK to be loaded
  - Standard NPM package
  - Snippet in `<script>` tag
  - RequireJS (may be dropped in future)
- Workflow is facilitated with both `make` and `yarn` (legacy, may possibly be updated to full `yarn`)
- Chek out the [Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer]((https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amplitude-instrumentation/acehfjhnmhbmgkedjmjlobpgdicnhkbp)) to help logging events during development

### Architecture

- `index.js` is the main entrypoint of SDK
- Stubbed methods are used when client imports via `<script>` snippet
  - Allows app to not be blocked while real JS SDK is loaded in
  - Sent events and identifys are tracked with queues
- Metadata storage (new) vs cookie (old) storage
  - more of issue with anonymous id, because it uses device id instead of user id
- UA Parser: Helps identify browsers
  - might be able to use upstream library and convert results, rather than our fork
- sameSiteCookie: Sets how public the cookie reading is
  - `amplitude.getInstance() is necessary even during reuse because of snippet stubbed
    - only applicable to snippet import

### Setting Up Development

- Cloning, installing, and building
```
git clone git@github.com:amplitude/Amplitude-JavaScript.git
cd Amplitude-JavaScript
make # Runs tests and generate builds
yarn dev # Start development utility. Open localhost:9000 in your browser to access
```

### Release

Releases are managed by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release). It is a tool that will scan commits since the last release, determine the next [semantic version number](https://semver.org/), publish, and create changelogs.

It requires developers to use [formal commit formats](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format). Below is a template

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <subject>

<optional BREAKING CHANGE and description> 

<optional body>
``` 

These conventions are enforced by [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/) ran on [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) git hooks. Developers can run `yarn commit` as a utility for creating these types of commits.

- Any commit with `BREAKING CHANGES` in the body will create a breaking release
- Else the `feat` type will do a feature release
- Else the `fix` type will do a patch release
- Else no release will occur
